 ## Introduction
 UCSD has plenty of courses, and honestly its a mess to make sense of all of it! This bot scrapes the UCSD course catalog and tries to find all the information you need

 ## Project Status
 I just literally started, so this will take a while to set up. Current plans include implementing a web scraper (and the discord bot). Further additions to the bot might eventually include building a prerequisite tree for each class to identify key prerequisites, and eventualy integration into a website.

 ## Packages used
 The packages used in this bot include
 * BeautifulSoup
 * Requests
